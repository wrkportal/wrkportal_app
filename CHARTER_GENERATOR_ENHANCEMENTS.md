## 💰 Token Cost Impact

### Before Enhancements:
- Input: ~850 tokens
- Output: ~2,500 tokens
- **Cost: $0.0016 per charter**

### After Enhancements:
- Input: ~1,000 tokens (+150 tokens for extra fields)
- Output: ~2,500-3,000 tokens (same or slightly more)
- **Cost: $0.0020 per charter**

**Increase: $0.0004 (0.04 cents more!) - Totally worth it!** ✅

### Why So Small?
