2. ✅ Monitor for any Next.js 14 security patches
3. ✅ Plan upgrade to Next.js 15.5.7 in a separate branch for testing

### For Development (Next Sprint):
1. Create a feature branch: `upgrade/nextjs-15`
2. Upgrade to Next.js 15.5.7
3. Test all features thoroughly
4. Fix any breaking changes
5. Deploy to staging first
6. Then deploy to production

## 🔍 Verification

After any upgrade, verify:

```bash
# Check installed versions
npm list next react react-dom

# Should show:
# - next@15.5.7 (or 16.0.7)
