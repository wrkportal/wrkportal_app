**Most Popular Badge:**
- Mark **Professional** as "Most Popular" to guide users toward middle tier
- This increases average revenue per user (ARPU)

### 3. **Feature Comparison Table**

**Display clearly**:
- ✅ Show what's included in each tier
- ✅ Highlight value in higher tiers
- ✅ Use checkmarks (✅) and X marks (❌)
- ✅ Show savings with annual plans
